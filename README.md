# Intro
Data analysis and data visualization are essential components of data science. Actually, before the machine learning era, all data science was about the interpretation and visualization of data with different tools and making conclusions about the nature of data. Nowadays, these tasks are still present. They just became one of many miscellaneous data science jobs. Very often, the so-called EDA (exploratory data analysis) is a required part of the machine learning pipeline. It allows a better understanding of data, its distribution, purity, features, etc. Also, visualization is recommended to present the results of the machine learning work to different stakeholders. They may not be familiar with sophisticated data science principles, but it is convenient for them to look at graphs and charts. Besides, data analysis and visualization can be done as standalone tasks if there is no need to dig deeper into the data. In any case, a good data scientist should know how to analyze and visualize data.
