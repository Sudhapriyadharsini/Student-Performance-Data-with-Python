# Student-Performance-Data-with-Python

# Intro
Data analysis and data visualization are essential components of data science. Actually, before the machine learning era, all data science was about the interpretation and visualization of data with different tools and making conclusions about the nature of data. Nowadays, these tasks are still present. They just became one of many miscellaneous data science jobs. Very often, the so-called EDA (exploratory data analysis) is a required part of the machine learning pipeline. It allows a better understanding of data, its distribution, purity, features, etc. Also, visualization is recommended to present the results of the machine learning work to different stakeholders. They may not be familiar with sophisticated data science principles, but it is convenient for them to look at graphs and charts. Besides, data analysis and visualization can be done as standalone tasks if there is no need to dig deeper into the data. In any case, a good data scientist should know how to analyze and visualize data.

### Steps Involved:
1. Import data from dataset and perform initial high-level analysis:
2. Data Exploration (look at the number of rows, look at the missing values, look at dataset columns and their values respective to the campaign outcome).
3. Data Cleaning(Cleaning the data: remove irrelevant columns)
4. dealing with missing and incorrect values,
5. turning categorical columns into dummy variables.
6. Use machine learning techniques to predict the marketing campaign outcome and to find out factors, which affect the success of the campaign.

### Libraries involved

1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib

### Database descriptions

The data is related with Student performance analyisis. The student data about male, female students their areas and father and mother jobs and anlysis the performance of students.

### Visualizations
1. Histrogram
2. Correlation
3. Boxplot / Pairplot
4. confusion matrix

### Explaination

On the heatmap, you can see correlation not only with the target variable, but also the variables between each other. For example, there is a strong correlation between father’s and mother’s education, the amount of time the student goes out and the alcohol consumption, number of failures and age of the student, etc. The exploration of correlations is one of the most important steps in EDA. It allows understanding which features may be useful, which are redundant, and which new features can be created artificially.

### Conclusion

We have also shown how to connect to your data lake using Dremio, as well as Dremio and Python code. During the work, we used Matplotlib and Seaborn packages.
